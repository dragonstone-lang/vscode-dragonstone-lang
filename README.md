# vscode-dragonstone-lang
This is the official VSCode extension for the [dragonstone programming language](https://github.com/Vallereya/dragonstone), please note that this is minimal at the moment and will be extended as the language grows. If you run into any issues add it in the [issues](https://github.com/vallereya/vscode-dragonstone-lang/issues) section. Thank You!

> NOTE: Embedded Dragonstone and the Forge Package Manager are temporary for now as they are not finished themselves.
