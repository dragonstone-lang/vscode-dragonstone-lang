# VSCode Extension for the Dragonstone Programming Language
## vscode-dragonstone-lang
This is the official VSCode extension and  provides support for the [dragonstone programming language](https://github.com/Vallereya/dragonstone). If you run into any issues add it in the [issues](https://github.com/dragonstone-lang/vscode-dragonstone-lang/issues) section. 

> Please note that this is minimal at the moment and will be extended as the language grows.

## Requirements:
It is recommended to install the [dragonstone programming language](https://github.com/Vallereya/dragonstone). After the language is install no other dependencies are required for this extension.

## Features:
- **Syntax Highlighting** (*via TextMate grammar*):
    - For Dragonstone (`.ds` and `.dragonstone`)
    - (coming soon...) For the Forge Package Manager (`.forge`)
    - (coming soon...) & Embedded Dragonstone (`.eds`)

> **Note**: Embedded Dragonstone and the Forge Package Manager are temporary for now as they are not finished themselves.

- **Language Server** (*LSP*):
    - Server/Client all-in-one.
    - Auto-completion with snippets.
    - Code formatting (4-space indentation is default for dragonstone).
    - Document symbols/outline view.
    - Go to definition (F12).
    - Hover to show symbol/type info.
    - Diagnostics for syntax/semantic errors.

- **Settings:**
    - **Toggle on/off**: Click status bar or use command palette.

> **Tip**: Click the status bar item (*right side*) to quickly toggle the *LSP* `ON`/`OFF`!

## Commands:
- `Dragonstone: Toggle Language Server`     -> Enable/disable LSP
- `Dragonstone: Enable Language Server`     -> Start the language server
- `Dragonstone: Disable Language Server`    -> Stop the language server

## Supported Platforms:
- Linux (Arch/Ubuntu)
- MacOS (Intel/Silicon)
- Windows (10+)
- GitHub Codespaces

## Roadmap:
As stated, this is minimal at the moment and will be extended as the language grows. These are some features that are planned or would be nice for the future:
- Better LSP.
- Better Completion.
- Better Detection.
- Add Debugger.
